									We've renovated before and never had an experience like Renovar offers, from the instant quote to the their helpful project Leaders I had my bathroom done earlier than expected. Will definitely recommend.

									I found the whole process to be so simple, there wasnt any mucking around with various painting quotes I recieved my price and they started 2 days later. They even helped with moving furniture.

									I was just looking for a quote for my kitchen, I waited and waited (as most of us do) I tried the Renovar platform. I must admit I was sceptical at first but their pricing was on the money. Job done well without a hitch. Very happy.
