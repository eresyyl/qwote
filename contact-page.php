				About Estimo
			</h1>
			<p>
We understand how much of a challenge it is for people to navigate through the renovations process. Whether it be finding out clearly and quickly how much they should spend right through to finding a good contractor to do the work, home renovations were stressful and extremely time consuming.
<br/>We saw an opportunity to alleviate the pain involved when improving your home and it all started with tackling the “how much will it cost” question. After 12 months of testing our pricing algorithms and the software we launched the platform to the world and welcomed the first accurate instant quoting portal for home improvement projects.
</br/>Our aim is to simplify the home improvement process by providing our customers with a one of a kind platform for pricing and managing projects along with matching them with a hand picked contractor to do the work.
We want change! We see the struggle homeowners go through and that was enough to find a better way. Estimo is the easiest way to improve your home!
